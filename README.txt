upnpower

A tool for enumerating and getting information from a UPNP enabled router over the network.

Returns information.
Returns Services
Returns Service.Actions
Returns Service.Actions.Arguments

If Service.Action takes no arguments then the Service.Action is executed as a function (caution) to return data.

First Time use:
1. Enumerate
2. Scan

The router may not always respond to the enumeration attempt and the enumeration is only necessary if the 
router resets and or if the enumeration data does not already exist, so use option 2 if
re-running upnpower [ SELECT PRE-ENUMERATED DATA ].
